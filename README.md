# SatelliteDataProcessing
.NET WPF App using a C# code base to process test data using the Galileo DLL and two Linked Lists. 

The Marlin scientists require a .NET WPF App (refer Appendix) using a C# code base to process the data using the Galileo DLL and two LinkedList’s; one for each satellite sensor. The data from each sensor must be read into a simple LinkedList of type “double” and then sorted using a Selection and Insertion sort algorithm. Next, the scientist will enter an integer value into a search textbox and select a Recursive or Iterative binary search algorithm. Finally, for each of the four algorithms the processing time must be measured and displayed. 

The Marlin scientists would like buttons for each action and several display options to examine the raw data and processed information. The application must have a single form that shows all the information from the two sensors. The following features are mandatory: 

A List Box to display the data from each Sensor. 

A List View with two columns to display the data from both sensors (Sensor A and Sensor B). 

A numeric input to control the standard deviation (Sigma) and mean (Mu) of the data. 

A button to load data into the two LinkedLists and then display these LinkedLists in a List View. 

A series of buttons to process the sort and search functions. 

Textbox display for the processing times each sort and search. 

You should consult with the CITE representative (your Lecturer) if you are unsure about any of the problems or questions in this assessment. Your primary research should focus on the resources on the Blackboard LMS and CITE web site, additional information can be collected from the Internet, ensure all sources are referenced in your submission. Ensure your development follows an Agile methodology that is recorded and maintained using your GitHub account. You must demonstrate your working applications before uploading to Blackboard, your Lecturer (Assessor) will sign off to ensure all the criteria are satisfied.
